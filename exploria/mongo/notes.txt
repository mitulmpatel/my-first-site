*THE LISTING PRICE MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE ACTUAL PRICE*
The space
There are 2 bedrooms with windows. One has a Queen sized bed, the other bedroom is meant to be an office but we added a single bed.
Guest access
The property has space for street parking. Since it is a new neighbourhood, buses do not run yet. You will need to either walk or drive to get to places.
Other things to note
We have a door that connects main floor and the suite for the convenience when we clean the space or just to enjoy the suite ourselves. Yes we love our suite that's why we want to share! However, when the guest are around, we lock the door with big padlocks on both sides just to provide sense of privacy for our guests. Therefore, nobody will ever surprise you through the door!", "image": "3.jpg", "amenities":"Bathtub,Hair dryer,Shampoo,Hot water,Washer,Dryer,Bed linens,Iron,Air conditioning,Smoke alarm,Wifi,Kitchen,Refrigerator,Cooking basics,Freezer,Coffee maker,Dining table" }
